      "AI Response:  MS Dhoni (Mahendra Singh Dhoni) is a former Indian cricketer who served as the captain of the Indian national team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2016, and Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. He led India to victory in the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup and is widely regarded as one of the greatest cricketers of all time. Dhoni made his international debut on 23 December 2004 against Bangladesh, but it was his performance at the 2007 T20 World Cup that caught everyone's attention, where he led India to victory and became a household name in India. He is known for his aggressive playing style, exceptional finishing abilities, and excellent wicket-keeping skills. After retiring from international cricket in 2020, Dhoni continues to play for the Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League (IPL).\n"
